The turtle pen on has had some changes recently.
There are some new things you may want to try.

The original round turtle pen was great for geometric line
art: all the round line ends and corners were easy to join up.

But what happens when you want to draw a bar graph?

<pre class="examp">
jumpto -50, -50
pen orange, 50
fd 100
jumpto 50, -50
pen red, 50
fd 50
</pre>

<script type="demo" height=199>
demo ->
  jumpto -50, -50
  pen orange, 50
  fd 100
  label '100'
  jumpto 50, -50
  pen red, 50
  fd 50
  label '50'
  moveto 0, 0
</script>

Although the right red bar (50) should be half the size
of the left orange bar (100), it's not.  The red bar is
too big because of the huge circular pen.

The solution is to use a flat pen.  In the
[web Canvas standard](http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/CR-2dcontext-20140821/#dom-context-2d-linecap),
a pen that draws flush flat line ends has a 'butt' lineCap
(as opposed to 'round' or 'square').  With the turtle
pen, you can get this by adding 'butt' (in quotes) as another
argument to the pen function

<pre class="examp">
jumpto -50, -50
pen orange, 50, 'butt'
fd 100
jumpto 50, -50
pen red, 50, 'butt'
fd 50
</pre>

<script type="demo" height=199>
demo ->
  jumpto -50, -50
  pen orange, 50, 'butt'
  fd 100
  label '100'
  jumpto 50, -50
  pen red, 50, 'butt'
  fd 50
  label '50'
  moveto 0, 0
</script>

That's better!
