Multiple Withings users have let me know that their Fat Mass data has disappeared from TrendWeight.  Apparently something is going on with the Withings API.  I don't know what the problem is yet, but I am investigating.  Please stay tuned.

**3/27 Update:**  I have confirmed with multiple users that the body fat data is simply missing from the data that the Withings API is giving TrendWeight.  At this point, I don't know of anything I can do to change that.  I still don't know why it is only happening to some people and not others.  I have sent an email to Withings support asking if they know of anything that might have changed, and someone from Withings has already responded and is actively investigating the problem.
