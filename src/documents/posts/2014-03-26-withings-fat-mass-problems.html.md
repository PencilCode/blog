Multiple Withings users have let me know that their Fat Mass data has disappeared from TrendWeight.  Apparently something is going on with the Withings API.  I don't know what the problem is yet, but I am investigating.  Please stay tuned.

**3/27 Update:**  I have confirmed with multiple users that the body fat data is simply missing from the data that the Withings API is giving TrendWeight.  At this point, I don't know of anything I can do to change that.  I still don't know why it is only happening to some people and not others.  I have sent an email to Withings support asking if they know of anything that might have changed, and someone from Withings has already responded and is actively investigating the problem.

**3/28 Updated:** A developer at Withings emailed me to let me know that the found and fixed the problem.  I confirmed that body mass data is once again appearing for several of the people who I know were affected and everything looks good.  I automatically did a full resync for all Withings users who updated in the last week (which should catch anyone who might have been affected), so your missing data should now be back.  If you notice anything wrong, though, don't hesitate to contact me.

 And thanks to the folks at Withings for finding and fixing the problem so quickly.
