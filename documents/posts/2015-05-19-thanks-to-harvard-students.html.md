We just wrapped up our Citizen Schools class, and I would like
to especially thank our volunteers from the Harvard Graduate School
of Education: Cindy Yang and Ji-Sun Ham, and thanks to Karen Brennan
for connecting us with them.

This Spring Cindy and Ji-Sun volunteered with Pencil Code to develop
a terrific 10-lesson seqence to use with Citizen Schools after-school
classrooms.  Citizen Schools runs extended-day programs in low-income
schools, where all the students participate in special "after-school"
classes hosted by volunteers in the community.  The kids arrive in these
after-school classes with a wide variety of interests, motivations,
and skills, so to meet the challenge of helping volunteer teachers
run  a highly differentiated classroom, Cindy and Ji-Sun came up
with the idea of _Pencil Cards_ - bite-sized activities on a card.

Teachers bring a pack of Pencil Cards to each class, and students can pick
a few to experiment with.  The idea is that the range of choice helps students
find project ideas that are both inspiring and at the right level for
themselves.  The cards are small enough that motivated students
can do a few in a class.  And there are a progression of cards going through
a number of topics in computational thinking.  The idea is inspired by
[Scratch Cards](https://scratch.mit.edu/help/cards/), a simple starter
tool for Scratch.

Here is an example card from our first-day deck:

The great thing about the Pencil Card project is that Cindy and Ji-sun
developed it while testing it in two classrooms, taught by
volunteer teachers, with middle- school students at Dorchester's
Dever-McCormack public school.  One classroom was taught by
a group of volunteers from John Hancock: Latisha Silvera,
Ramakrishna Arugollu, and Kevin Egan, who had never used Pencil Code before.
The other classroom was taught by Google volunteers Yana Malysheva
and Ethan Apter.  Informed by their experiences in the classroom,
our volunteers contributed several of the ideas for the cards (inluding
Yana's very popular monkey, above.)

There are 10 weekly classes in a Citizen Schools class, and in
the last three classes, the students learned HTML, and used
that knowledge to develop online portfolios of their work.

At the end of the class, the students presented their portfolios
at a fair that Citizen Schools calls the "Wow" event, attended by
parents and many other adults and professionals from the community.
It was incredible to see the students presenting and explaining
their own work at the event.  Suddenly, they were the experts in
the room, explaining their technology and showing off their creative
ideas to all the visiting professionals.  We were all impressed,
and I think we have several future software entrepreneurs in the
making.

I have helped to teach with Pencil Code in Citizen Schools classes
for several semesters, but this term was unique because of the
Pencil Card format.  The format allowed every student to develop
a deep portfolio of individual work (as opposed to working only one
team project), so every student was fully engaged, and every student
wrote a lot of code.  At the end, every student, regardless of level,
was able to present and explain their own inventions.

Next, Citizen Schools will package the curriculum in a form that
they can use with classrooms nationwide.  They have scheduled that
work this summer, for use nationwide in the fall!

Bravo, and thanks to Cindy and Ji-Sun, Citizen Schools, and
the 2015 teachers and students in the DMC Pencil Code classrooms.

Cindy and Ji-Sun have been thinking of running a kickstarter to pay
for a run of professional printing of the cards.  Let us know if
you might be interested!
