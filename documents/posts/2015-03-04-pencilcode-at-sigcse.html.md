Just a quick note: Pencil Code will be presenting at the [SIGCSE
conference](http://sigcse2015.sigcse.org/) this week.
Here is a [link to the slide deck](http://goo.gl/PgIx1t) for the
workshop we will present - it includes links to some curriculum
materials that we are testing with Citizen Schools and with Google,
and to some interesting, but preliminary, research results from
pilot testing in classrooms.
