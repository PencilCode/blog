Pencil Code gave a popular workshop at the
[CSTA 2015](http://csta.acm.org/ProfessionalDevelopment/sub/CSTA15/CSTA2015Sessions.pdf)
conference in Texas.  In an email afterwards, one attendee
commented "Incredible updates to Pencil Code including an HTML
web publishing option....  session was packed - there were people
sitting on the floor!"  We worked with teachers from around the
country, as well as groups like CodeHS and Codesters who are doing
really interesting new work.

One question came up: "Why is it called Pencil Code?"

Our project is named after the pencil because we are inspired
by the history of that writing instrument.  We think of the
pencil as a classroom tool, something simple enough for a young
child.

But it was not always this way.  The original graphite pencil
was an expensive technical implement, a square stick of
carbon sawn from a graphite mine in England.  Rare and fragile,
it was used by draftsmen and architects who valued its precise,
dry dark line.

Centuries of innovation made the pencil more accessible:
through the ingenuity of many inventors, the pencil has acquired
a round wooden case, cheap and consistent clay-hardened lead, the
attached rubber eraser, and pencil sharpeners.  It is this history
of innovation which has allowed the pencil to displace the inkwell
and pen as the first writing tool for students.  And yet the
pencil remains a favorite instrument for adult writers, architects and
mathematicians.

Can the technical tools used by computer scientists evolve
like the pencil?

Pencil Code tries to begin to answer that question.  It is
designed to be flexible and simple enough to loved by both
beginners and pros.

When using Pencil Code, advanced coders are comfortable
typing in Javascript, Coffeescript, and HTML: standard
languages that pros use every day.  But beginners
can edit those same languages with drag-and-drop, manipulating
color-coded blocks.  Pencil Code bridges the worlds by allowing
users to transform their programs between blocks
and text freely.

Like a pencil, Pencil Code is designed to be a low-threshold
high-ceiling tool.  Our turtle library is an extension of jQuery,
a design that is convenient for both beginners and pros.
We include socket.io, which makes it possible to solve the
very advanced problem of realtime communications with a very
beginner-friendly six lines of code.

A lot of work remains to be done to try to match the
power and simplicity of a pencil.  This year, contributors
have created instructional cards and improved ergaonomics
for beginners; and we are working on adding more advanced
facilities such as python, libraries like p5, and databases.

We have an online Slack group where contributors and edcuators
gather.  If you would like to use Pencil Code in your classroom
or contribute to the open-source project, please join us, and
