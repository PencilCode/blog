A brief note from the [IDC 2015](http://idc2015boston.org/)
conference, which is just wrapping up in Boston, hosted at Tufts.

There was a lot of interesting goings-on at the conference, including
a fascinating workshop on
[Every Child A Coder?](http://everychildacoder.org.uk/) organized
by Kate Howland, Judith Good, and Judy Robertson.  There we
wrestled with the question of universal computer science education,
bringing child development specialists toether with computer
scientists to think through an approach to introducing
appropriate computational concepts and practices at all ages.
The workshop was an opportunity to meet a number of other
teachers and researchers with overlapping interests,
including Jeremiah Blanchard, who is intersested in extending
Pencil Code to support python for his college classrooms.

In the main workshop, a lot of fascinating work was presented.
The paper that interested me most was
David Weintrop's [To Block or not to Block](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2771860),
which analyzed perceptions of high school students toward block
programming as they took a programming class. Under different
conditions, the class mixed blocks and text programming in different
ways.  David has been carefully pulling apart the ways in which
students find blocks valuable - for example, he has found that
there may be more value in the browsability and the compsability of
the blocks, rather than the natural-language labels in the blocks.
He has also found that student perceptions of the value of blocks
change as they advance through the class, and as they move to
text programming.

Anthony's Droplet work, which is the dual-mode block-and-text
editor used in Pencil Code, is right at the center of these
discussions.  Since Pencil Code allows
students to freely switch between blocks and text, it raises the
question of whether perceived hurdles and differences between
blocks and text can be smoothed out.

It is a pleasure to be able to benefit from the insights that
David Weintrop has been uncovering, and we are excited to be working
with him to use Pencil Code as a research platform for his research.
