Congratulations, and welcome to our Google Summer of Code students, who
are about to start their summers working with Pencil Code.  Each of
the three students submitted and impressive proposal which earned them
Google Summer of Code funding to support their work this summer
making open-source technical contributions to Pencil Code.

It was a very competitive application process.  This year, 37 applications
for Pencil Code proposals were reviewed by a group of engineers and teachers
working with Pencil Code, and three projects were ultimately chosen based on
their anticipated educational impact and engineering feasibility.  Funding
from Google is incredibly generous, but still, there were many more
impressive proposals than available funding slots.

The three Summer of Code students for Pencil Code in 2015 are:

**Saksham Aggarwal** - for a project to develop block-mode editors
that will allow beginners to visually work with HTML and CSS syntax.

**Liu Xinan** - for a project to automatically create visual snapshots
of student projects to allow students and teachers to more easily
find and share their work.

**Jeremy Ruten** - for a project to help develop an improved visual
debugger for Pencil Code, to help students understand their code by
visually tracing execution.

This is an international group, and the students will work remotely
from Singapore, India, and Canada.

All three of these projects are ambitious, but the students
have put together impressive proposals on how they will tackle them
this summer.  We are looking forward to collaborating with
this talented group.  The goal is to create some significant
educational improvements for Pencil Code by next fall.

The full list of Google Summer of Code program
participants this year, across all the open source projects, can be found

Congratulations!
